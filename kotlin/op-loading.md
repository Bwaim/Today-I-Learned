# Operator Overloading in Kotlin

Kotlin supports a technique called **conventions**, everyone should be familiar with. For example, if you define a special method `plus` in your class, you can use the `+` operator *by convention*: That's called Kotlin Operator Overloading.

In this article, I want to show you which conventions you can use and I will also provide a few [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org) code examples that demonstrate the concepts.
